parsing
=======

Scala library for parsing and creating objects that can be easily parsed from
strings. Meant in its current state to be included as a submodule in a larger
project. At some point, it may turn into a library that can be included into
a project without bothering with the source.

Project is in early development. As far as I know, it's only for my personal
use, but let me know if you wish to contribute. Documentation coming soon.
