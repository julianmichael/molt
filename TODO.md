To Do List
==========

 * Try wrapping parsing monad in a scalaz Free monad to avoid stack overflows

 * A way to specify wildcards and do basic functional uncertainty

 * A whitespace-sensitive preprocessor that can add in brackets or other
   delimiters where changes in scope are detected. (See the whitespace
   sensitivity in Haskell for inspiration.) It will take in "indentation
   indicator tokens" that will trigger the mechanism. (like Haskell keywords)

 * An example system for producing symbolic objects from F-Structures.

 * Thread failure reporting, somehow, through the parsing calculations.
